# Cult of the Bound Variable (CBV)

The code here implements the virtual machine and I expect perhaps some solutions to puzzles from the following
infamous programming contest.

CBV was an amazing programming contest associated with [ICFP](https://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/ICFP/) 2006 
which is now archived at [boundvariable.org](http://boundvariable.org) and is so fun, people evidently still like
to try the puzzles.

The first task is to implement a virtual machine as specified in ancient stone tablets recently unearthed,
or so the backstory goes.

Once the VM boots with the provided image (after much debugging) the main sequence of puzzles is revealed in
a hilarious adventure.

filter for grabbing the "publications" which appear in the console output, signifying each  
_achievement unlocked_ moment.
